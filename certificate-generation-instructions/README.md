# Open SSL CSR Generation for ICP Sandbox Certificates  - GT Seguran√ßa - Open Banking Brasil

These sh scripts and openssl configuration files can be used to create certificates that conform to the ICP Standards defined for Brazil. Please remember that all data in the config `.cnf` files must match exactly the data that is included in the directory.

## Error Handling

At present the directory is not returning detailed error messages when a CSR fails validation. This is being addressed as a priority.
